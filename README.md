# Interactive List

An interactive list with React Native.

# About

I really like this repository. This list drag and drop action was something I found interesting, I really like the result I got.

# Why?

I wanted to make some application in react-native. One thing I had never done was a list with the drag and drop option. It was something that required a lot, but it was very rewarding to know that it worked and today I have the algorithm in case I need to use it later.

# Using:

This application was built using: React-native, TypeScript, Gesture-Handle.
